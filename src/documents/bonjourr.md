### âœ… Chrome and Brave

You can download Bonjourr for Chrome and Brave directly on the [Chrome Web Store](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/bonjourr-%C2%B7-minimalist-lig/dlnejlppicbjfcfcedcflplfjajinajd?hl=fr&authuser=0).

### âœ… Firefox

You can download Bonjourr for Firefox directly on the [Firefox Addons page](https://addons.mozilla.org/fr/firefox/addon/bonjourr-startpage/).

### ðŸ”¶ Safari

Bonjourr is currently unavailable on Safari. Since we donâ€™t earn any money with Bonjourr, it wouldnâ€™t make sense for us to pay for an Apple Developper account since those are quite pricey, which means we arenâ€™t able to publish it on their store.

However, there is still a way to use Bonjourr with Safariâ€¦

If youâ€™d like to help us financially, because we would still love to publish Bonjourr on Safari, you can [donate here](https://ko-fi.com/bonjourr).

### âœ… Edge

Bonjourr is available on the [Microsoft Edge Addons](https://microsoftedge.microsoft.com/addons/detail/bonjourr/dehmmlejmefjphdeoagelkpaoolicmid) store.

Once youâ€™ve installed Bonjourr, youâ€™ll need to enable it for it to be active. Enter `edge://extensions` in your adress bar, locate Bonjourr and click on the switch.

### ðŸ›‘ Opera

Unfortunately, Bonjourr is not available nor usable in any way on Opera. According to [their acceptance criteria](https://dev.opera.com/extensions/acceptance-criteria/), *Extensions cannot replace Operaâ€™s default start page*. 

### ðŸ”¶ Bonjourr on iOS

Unfortunately, Safari on iOS doesnâ€™t allow developpers to replace its startpage. However, you can install it as a web app by visiting online.bonjourr.fr, going to the Share menu and then â€˜Add to Home Screenâ€™. iOS will then create an icon on you homescreen that will start Bonjourr when you open it.

The other way would be to start using another browser than Safari, like [Firefox](https://apps.apple.com/fr/app/navigateur-web-firefox/id989804926), which allows its users to replace their startpage. You can then add `online.bonjourr.fr` as a startpage.

### ðŸ”¶ Bonjourr on Android
