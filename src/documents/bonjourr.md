Deleting your cache will also reset Bonjourr, so **consider keeping a copy of its settings somewhere in a notes app** (Show all settings → Export code).

<!-- Bonjourr is available on the  store.

Once you’ve installed Bonjourr, you’ll need to enable it for it to be active. Enter `edge://extensions` in your adress bar, locate Bonjourr and click on the switch.
If you’d like to help us financially, because we would still love to publish Bonjourr on Safari, you can [donate here](https://ko-fi.com/bonjourr).
Thanks to caching, Bonjourr will keep your settings and feel almost as fast as a local page.
Opera doesn't support Bonjourr.  _Extensions cannot replace Opera’s default start page_. According to [their acceptance criteria](https://dev.opera.com/extensions/acceptance-criteria/), -->
