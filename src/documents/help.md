## üíµ Donations

A few donations go a long way when it comes to open source software. It motivates us to pour more time into Bonjourr, it helps us realise people care about our work and it can open new doors for the future.

## üá¨üáß Translations

Thanks to our contributors, Bonjourr is currently available in 14 languages (English, French, Slovene, Swedish, Polish, Brasilian Portuguese, Dutch, Italian, Spanish, Russian, Simplified Chinese, German, Norwegian & Ukrainian). This is great, but since we're constantly adding new features to Bonjourr, some translations might have become incomplete.

If you spot a missing string, you can head to [this file on GitHub](https://github.com/victrme/Bonjourr/blob/master/src/scripts/lang.js), translate it and create a pull request.

If you'd like to add a new language, you can use [this commit](https://github.com/victrme/Bonjourr/commit/7831760d74b403b0a4e285cb0880e07b74507dee) as an example.

We've recently added the overview.md file, which means you can now translate Bonjourr's description in browser extensions stores as well.
