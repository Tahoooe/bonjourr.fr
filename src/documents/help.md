Thanks to our contributors, Bonjourr is currently available in 16 languages (English, French, Slovene, Swedish, Polish, Brasilian Portuguese, Dutch, Italian, Spanish, Russian, Simplified Chinese, German, Ukrainian, Danish, Turkish and Indonesian). This is great, but some translations might have become incomplete as we've added more features.
