## Various tips and tricks
- Bonjourr doesn't show all its settings by default. If you're an advanced user or just curious, you'll want to enable them all at the top of the settings pannel.
- Hitting the `escape` key opens the settings.
- When the searchbar is enabled, you can start typing in it right away. As long as you're focused on the page, your inputs will automatically go to the search bar.

## About Quick Links
You can add Quick Links directly from the settings, and edit them when you right click on them.

An easy way to add a custom icon to your Quick Link is to upload it somewhere like [Imgur](https://imgur.com/), and use that link as an icon.

The number of Quick Links you can add to Bonjourr is limited. If you can't add another link, try reducing the others' sizes by removing titles or superfluous URL query strings for example.

⚠️ **Notice**: browser settings links like `about:config` or `chrome://extensions` can't be added as a security measure. However, `localhost:` links will work fine.

## About backgrounds
Bonjourr uses the [Unsplash API](https://unsplash.com/developers) to fetch its backgrounds. We select them manually and store them in four different collections that change according to the time of the day:
- [Bonjourr Noon](https://unsplash.com/collections/yDjgRh1iqkQ/bonjourr-backgrounds-(noon))
- [Bonjourr Day](https://unsplash.com/collections/4933370/bonjourr-backgrounds-(day)), our main collection
- [Bonjourr Evening](https://unsplash.com/collections/2nVzlQADDIE/bonjourr-backgrounds-(evening))
- [Bonjourr Night](https://unsplash.com/collections/VI5sx2SDQUg/bonjourr-backgrounds-(night))

## About custom backgrounds
There are two ways you can set your own backgrounds in Bonjourr: via Unsplash, or locally.

### Unsplash
You can make your own collection of images using [Unsplash](https://unsplash.com/). To do so, you'll need to create an Unsplash account and add all your images to a new collection. Once you're pleased with your selection, you need the collection's ID present in its URL. You will spot it easily since it's the string of random letters and numbers. For example, if your collection's URL is `https://unsplash.com/collections/2170139/wolfdogs-of-unsplash`, the ID is `2170139`.

Head back to Bonjourr and paste this in the **Unsplash collection** field. You can add multiple collection by separating them with a comma.

### Locally
Switch your background type from Dynamic to Custom, and you'll be able to drag and drop your own images from your computer in Bonjourr.

With both of those methods, you can then cycle through your images every tab, every hour or every day like with regular backgrounds.
