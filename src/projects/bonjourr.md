### Chrome and Brave

You can download Bonjourr for Chrome and Brave directly on the [Chrome Web Store](#).

### Firefox

You can download Bonjourr for Firefox directly on the Firefox Addons page.

### Safari

Bonjourr is currently unavailable on Safari. Since we don’t earn any money with Bonjourr, it wouldn’t make sense for us to pay for an Apple Developper account since those are quite pricey, which means we aren’t able to publish it on their store.

However, there is still a way to use Bonjourr with Safari…

If you’d like to help us financially, because we would still love to publish Bonjourr on Safari, you can donate here.

### Edge

You can download Bonjourr on the Microsoft Edge addon store here.

Once you’ve installed Bonjourr, you’ll need to enable it for it to be active. Enter edge://extensions in your adress bar, locate Bonjourr and click on the switch.

### Opera

Unfortunately, Bonjourr is not available nor usable in any way on Opera. According to their acceptance criteria, *Extensions cannot replace Opera’s default start page*.

### Bonjourr on iOS

Unfortunately, Safari on iOS doesn’t allow developpers to replace its startpage. However, you can install it as a web app by visiting online.bonjourr.fr, going to the Share menu and then ‘Add to Home Screen’. iOS will then create an icon on you homescreen that will start Bonjourr when you open it.

The other way would be to start using another browser than Safari, like Firefox, which allows its users to replace their startpage. You can then add online.bonjourr.fr as a startpage.

### Bonjourr on Android
